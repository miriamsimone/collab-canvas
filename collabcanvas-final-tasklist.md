## 🚨 CRITICAL REMINDERS - PERFORMANCE FIRST

1. **PERFORMANCE IS CRITICAL** ⚡ - MVP is already laggy, fix architecture FIRST
2. **Day 1-2 Are Make-or-Break** - Performance + AI foundation must be solid
3. **Don't Add Features to Broken Foundation** - Fix perf before expanding
4. **Test Performance Continuously** - Monitor FPS, memory, network after each change
5. **MVP Foundation is Solid** ✅ - Build on it, don't break the working parts
6. **Quality Over Quantity** - 4 excellent features > 8 laggy ones  
7. **AI Must Be Reliable** - Focus on working commands over complex features
8. **Deploy Often** - Deploy after major PRs for validation
9. **Reserve Day 6** - Only testing and bug fixes, no new features
10. **Fail Fast** - If performance fixes don't work by Day 1 end, pivot strategy

### 🚨 PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS (MUST MEET):
- **Current State**: Laggy with basic rectangles
- **Day 1 Target**: 60 FPS with 100+ rectangles  
- **Day 2 Target**: AI + performance both working
- **Final Target**: 60 FPS with 200+ mixed objects + 5 users

### 🚨 BACKUP PLAN IF PERFORMANCE FAILS:
- **Plan B**: Focus on fewer objects but perfect UX (50 objects max)
- **Plan C**: Simplify AI to basic commands only
- **Plan D**: Cut complex features, perfect the basics

## 📝 Notes

- **Commit Strategy:** Commit after completing each subtask
- **Branch Strategy:** Create feature branches for each PR
- **Testing:** Write tests as you implement features
- **Code Review:** Self-review code before merging
- **Production Testing:** Test every major feature in production
- **Backup:** Keep MVP working at all times - have rollback plan

**Remember: The goal is A grade (90-100 points), not perfection. Ship excellent features, not everything.**
