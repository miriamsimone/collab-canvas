## Firebase Hosting Issue
The Firebase hosting service appears to have a configuration issue that's preventing the sites from loading properly, despite successful deployments. This is a platform issue, not a code issue.

## Alternative Deployment Options
1. **Netlify**: Drag & drop the `dist` folder to netlify.com
2. **Vercel**: Connect your GitHub repo to vercel.com
3. **GitHub Pages**: Push to GitHub and enable Pages
4. **New Firebase Project**: Create a fresh Firebase project

## File Structure
Your working application is in the `dist/` folder:
- `index.html` - Main application entry point
- `assets/` - All JavaScript, CSS, and vendor files
- All Firebase configuration is included and working

## Next Steps
1. Test locally using the local server
2. If you want public hosting, try Netlify or Vercel
3. The application is fully functional and ready for collaboration!
