# Fix Vercel Authentication Issue

## The Problem
Your Vercel deployments are working but showing Vercel's login page instead of your app. This usually means the project is set to private.

## Solution: Make Project Public

### Option 1: Via Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your "collab-canvas" project
3. Go to **Settings** → **General**
4. Look for **"Project Visibility"** or **"Privacy"** setting
5. Change from **"Private"** to **"Public"**
6. Save changes

### Option 2: Via CLI
Run this command to make the project public:
```bash
vercel project public
```

## Test URLs (Latest)
After making it public, try these URLs:
- https://collab-canvas-aeyt6nrdd-miriam-simones-projects.vercel.app (Latest)
- https://collab-canvas-t5cahgexi-miriam-simones-projects.vercel.app

## Expected Result
✅ You should see YOUR app's login/registration page (not Vercel's)
✅ Anyone can access and create accounts
✅ Real-time collaboration will work

## Alternative: Get Clean URL
If you want a cleaner URL like `collab-canvas.vercel.app`:
1. In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Domains
2. Add `collab-canvas.vercel.app` (if available)
3. Or choose any available name

The hash URLs are normal for Vercel projects without custom domains!
