## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: AI Agent Complexity
**Mitigation:** Start with simple commands, test thoroughly, add complexity incrementally. Use proven function calling libraries.

### Risk 2: Performance Degradation
**Mitigation:** Implement optimizations early (viewport culling, object pooling). Test with large object counts throughout development.

### Risk 3: Feature Scope Creep
**Mitigation:** Prioritize rubric requirements. Use the point system to guide decisions. Cut nice-to-haves ruthlessly if time runs short.

### Risk 4: Multi-User AI Conflicts
**Mitigation:** Implement AI command queue. Test concurrent usage early. Ensure Firestore sync handles AI-generated objects identically to manual ones.

### Risk 5: Last-Minute Bugs
**Mitigation:** Reserve Day 6 for testing and fixes only. Deploy early and often. Keep Day 5 builds stable and deployable.

- Mobile support (tablet/phone)
- Offline mode
- Real-time voice/video chat
- Animation/transitions between states
- Plugin system
- Advanced vector tools (pen tool, boolean ops)
- Cloud storage integration
- Team/workspace management
- Payment/monetization
- Analytics dashboard
