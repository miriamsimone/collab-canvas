## üìã Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (using NVM recommended)
- Firebase CLI
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/miriamsimone/collab-canvas.git
   cd collab-canvas
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase**
   - The app uses hardcoded Firebase config in `src/services/firebase.ts`
   - For development, you can replace with your own Firebase project config

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run test:run  # Run once
   ```

### Firebase Setup (For Custom Deployment)

1. **Create Firebase Project**
   ```bash
   # Install Firebase CLI
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   
   # Login to Firebase
   firebase login
   
   # Initialize Firebase in your project
   firebase init
   ```

2. **Configure Firebase Services**
   - **Firestore**: Enable database with security rules from `firestore.rules`
   - **Authentication**: Enable Email/Password provider
   - **Hosting**: Configure with `public` folder as `dist`

3. **Update Configuration**
   - Replace Firebase config in `src/services/firebase.ts` with your project values
   - Deploy security rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`

### Available Scripts

## üöÄ Deployment

### Vercel Deployment (Primary)
- **üåê Live App**: https://collab-canvas-miriam.vercel.app
- **üìñ Full Deployment Guide**: See [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](./DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Always update the Vercel alias after deployment! See the deployment guide for details.

### Firebase Deployment (Alternative)
```bash
# Build and deploy to Firebase
npm run deploy

# Deploy only hosting (faster)
npm run deploy:hosting

# Deploy only Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**CORS Errors with Firebase**
- Ensure Firebase config is properly set in `src/services/firebase.ts`
- Check that Firestore security rules are deployed
- Verify project ID matches in all configurations

**Cursor/Presence Not Working**
- Check browser console for Firebase connection errors
- Ensure user is authenticated before accessing presence features
- Verify Firestore rules allow read/write access to `presence` collection

**Build Failures**
- Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`
- Check TypeScript errors: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Verify all required environment variables are set

**Performance Issues**
- Monitor bundle size with `npm run build`
- Check for memory leaks in presence/cursor subscriptions
- Limit concurrent users during testing

## üìù Development Process

This project was built following a structured 24-hour MVP approach:

- **10 Pull Requests** covering all major features
- **Continuous deployment** after each milestone  
- **Test-driven development** with unit and integration tests
- **Real-time validation** with multi-user production testing

### Architecture Decisions
- **Firestore over WebSockets**: Easier scaling and offline support
- **Optimistic Updates**: Better UX with rollback on conflicts
- **Component-based Architecture**: Reusable and maintainable code
- **TypeScript**: Better DX and fewer runtime errors
