# 🎨 CollabCanvas MVP

A real-time collaborative design canvas that enables multiple users to create, manipulate, and view design elements simultaneously. Built with React, Firebase, and Konva.js for bulletproof multiplayer collaboration.

**🌐 Live Demo**: https://collab-canvas-2e4c5.web.app

## ✨ Features

### 🤝 **Real-time Collaboration**
- **Multiplayer Editing**: Multiple users can create and move rectangles simultaneously
- **Live Cursors**: See other users' cursors with their names in real-time
- **Presence Awareness**: Know who's currently online with live user count
- **Conflict Resolution**: Optimistic updates with automatic rollback on errors

### 🖼️ **Canvas Experience**
- **Smooth Navigation**: Pan and zoom across a 5000x5000px workspace
- **Interactive Tools**: Rectangle creation and selection tools
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected objects with transform handles
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### 🔐 **User Experience**
- **Secure Authentication**: Firebase Auth with email/password
- **State Persistence**: Canvas survives page refreshes and disconnects
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error recovery with user notifications
- **Performance**: Optimized for 5+ concurrent users

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Canvas**: Konva.js + React-Konva for 2D graphics rendering
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore + Authentication + Hosting)
- **Real-time**: Firestore real-time listeners for live collaboration
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library + Unit/Integration tests
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated testing and deployment

## 📋 Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (using NVM recommended)
- Firebase CLI
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/miriamsimone/collab-canvas.git
   cd collab-canvas
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase**
   - The app uses hardcoded Firebase config in `src/services/firebase.ts`
   - For development, you can replace with your own Firebase project config

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run test:run  # Run once
   ```

### Firebase Setup (For Custom Deployment)

1. **Create Firebase Project**
   ```bash
   # Install Firebase CLI
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   
   # Login to Firebase
   firebase login
   
   # Initialize Firebase in your project
   firebase init
   ```

2. **Configure Firebase Services**
   - **Firestore**: Enable database with security rules from `firestore.rules`
   - **Authentication**: Enable Email/Password provider
   - **Hosting**: Configure with `public` folder as `dist`

3. **Update Configuration**
   - Replace Firebase config in `src/services/firebase.ts` with your project values
   - Deploy security rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm test` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:run` - Run tests once
- `npm run lint` - Lint code

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture pattern:

- **Components**: React components for UI and canvas rendering
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks for state management and Firebase integration
- **Services**: Firebase service layer and API abstraction
- **Utils**: Utility functions for canvas operations and color management

## 🚀 Deployment

### Automated Deployment
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions automatically tests and deploys on push to `main`
- **Preview**: PR deployments create preview URLs for testing
- **Production**: Live at https://collab-canvas-2e4c5.web.app

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Build and deploy to Firebase
npm run deploy

# Deploy only hosting (faster)
npm run deploy:hosting

# Deploy only Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**CORS Errors with Firebase**
- Ensure Firebase config is properly set in `src/services/firebase.ts`
- Check that Firestore security rules are deployed
- Verify project ID matches in all configurations

**Cursor/Presence Not Working**
- Check browser console for Firebase connection errors
- Ensure user is authenticated before accessing presence features
- Verify Firestore rules allow read/write access to `presence` collection

**Build Failures**
- Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`
- Check TypeScript errors: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Verify all required environment variables are set

**Performance Issues**
- Monitor bundle size with `npm run build`
- Check for memory leaks in presence/cursor subscriptions
- Limit concurrent users during testing

## 📝 Development Process

This project was built following a structured 24-hour MVP approach:

- **10 Pull Requests** covering all major features
- **Continuous deployment** after each milestone  
- **Test-driven development** with unit and integration tests
- **Real-time validation** with multi-user production testing

### Architecture Decisions
- **Firestore over WebSockets**: Easier scaling and offline support
- **Optimistic Updates**: Better UX with rollback on conflicts
- **Component-based Architecture**: Reusable and maintainable code
- **TypeScript**: Better DX and fewer runtime errors

## 🤝 Contributing
