# AI Commands Implementation - Complete âœ…

## Summary
Successfully added **all remaining AI command categories** to complete the AI Canvas Agent feature. The AI can now handle 8/8 command categories with complex multi-step operations.

---

## âœ… Completed Command Categories (8/8 - 100%)

### 1. **Shape Creation** âœ… (Already Complete)
- Rectangles, Circles, Lines, Text
- Examples:
  - "create a red rectangle at 100, 100"
  - "add a blue circle with 50px radius"
  - "draw a line from 0,0 to 100,100"

### 2. **Selection** âœ… (Already Complete)
- Select all, by color, by position
- Examples:
  - "select all red shapes"
  - "select objects in top half"

### 3. **Bulk Operations** âœ… (Already Complete)
- Move, delete, change color
- Examples:
  - "move selected objects 50 pixels right"
  - "delete selected objects"

### 4. **Resize Operations** âœ… **NEW**
- Scale factor or specific dimensions
- Works with rectangles (width/height) and circles (radius)
- Examples:
  - "make the circle twice as big"
  - "resize the rectangle to 300x200"
  - "scale selected objects by 1.5"

### 5. **Rotate Operations** âœ… **NEW**
- Rotate by degrees
- Examples:
  - "rotate the text 45 degrees"
  - "rotate selected objects 90 degrees"

### 6. **Alignment Operations** âœ… **NEW**
- Align left, center, right, top, middle, bottom
- Examples:
  - "align all selected objects to the left"
  - "center the rectangles horizontally"
  - "align to top"

### 7. **Distribution Operations** âœ… **NEW**
- Distribute horizontally or vertically
- Requires 3+ objects
- Examples:
  - "distribute selected objects evenly horizontally"
  - "space these circles vertically"

### 8. **Z-Index (Layer Management)** âœ… **NEW**
- Bring to front, send to back, bring forward, send backward
- Examples:
  - "bring the red rectangle to front"
  - "send the background to back"
  - "move the text above everything"

### 9. **Complex Multi-Step Commands** âœ… **NEW**
- AI breaks down complex requests into multiple actions
- Examples:
  - "create a login form" â†’ Creates username label + input + password label + input + login button
  - "create a navigation bar with 4 items" â†’ Creates multiple text elements arranged horizontally
  - "build a card layout" â†’ Creates title, image placeholder, description arranged vertically

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:

#### 1. **API Endpoint** (`api/ai/command.ts`)
- âœ… Added 5 new schema types: `resizeShapeSchema`, `rotateShapeSchema`, `alignObjectsSchema`, `distributeObjectsSchema`, `zIndexSchema`
- âœ… Updated system prompt with comprehensive examples for all 9 operation types
- âœ… Updated action type enum to include: `resizeShape`, `rotateShape`, `alignObjects`, `distributeObjects`, `zIndex`
- âœ… Added validation logic for all new action types
- âœ… Taught AI how to break down complex commands into multiple sequential actions

#### 2. **useAI Hook** (`src/hooks/useAI.ts`)
- âœ… Added 5 new optional props: `onResize`, `onRotate`, `onAlign`, `onDistribute`, `onZIndex`
- âœ… Added handlers for all new action types in the execution loop
- âœ… Integrated with existing selection and shape management systems

#### 3. **Canvas Component** (`src/components/Canvas.tsx`)
- âœ… Implemented `handleAIResize` - handles both rectangles (width/height) and circles (radius) with scale factor support
- âœ… Implemented `handleAIRotate` - rotates shapes by degrees
- âœ… Implemented `handleAIAlign` - integrates with `useAlignment` hook and command pattern
- âœ… Implemented `handleAIDistribute` - integrates with distribution functions and command pattern
- âœ… Implemented `handleAIZIndex` - integrates with `useZIndex` hook and command pattern
- âœ… All new AI operations use the undo/redo command pattern (fully undoable)
- âœ… Connected all handlers to the useAI hook
